    <p class="govuk-body">This service will give you information about the different options available to make a child
      maintenance arrangement. These are:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>making your own arrangement</li>
      <li>using the Child Maintenance Service</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Contact Child Maintenance Choices if you live in Northern Ireland</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using the Child Maintenance Service</h2>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you already have an active case</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you have a case with the same parent you should report a
      change of circumstances instead of making a new arrangement. You can use this service if you want to set up
      a new arrangement with a different parent.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Fees</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service the application fee is £20 and cannot be
      refunded. You’ll need a debit or credit card to pay this. It does not guarantee an arrangement.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You will not have to pay the application fee if you:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>are under 19 years old</li>
      <li>have experienced domestic abuse</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Get help if you have experienced domestic abuse</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're worried about contacting the other parent</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service, we will try to contact the other parent
      about setting up child maintenance – you do not need to.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will share the following details with the other parent:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your name</li>
      <li>your child’s name and date of birth</li>
      <li>the number of days your child stays with the parent who will be making payments - the other parent will need
        to confirm this</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      We will not share any other information with the other parent unless you ask us to.
